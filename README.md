# Course_Work
The main idea of ​​our work is to make a handler for encrypting messages.
We have several implementations of this, using an example of an object, using Unicode, and also implementing the idea of ​​asymmetric encryption.
In addition, you can create a password on our website by setting the necessary conditions for it.

Above the term paper worked: 
Makoviy Victor - cipher.js,
Ivan Kovalchuk - comment.js, encryption.js
Shchaslyvyi Arseny - main.js
